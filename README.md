# Getting Started

## Git stuff
* Choose one member of your team to fork this repository into their github account by clicking the fork button. Or if you have a team account, use that. This fork will be considered the "main" repository.

* To clone the main repo: `git clone https://github.com/{ACCOUNT_NAME}/ysys-app.git`

* To contribute to your project, we recommend this common pattern:
  - Checkout the main branch locally: `git checkout main`
  - Make sure this is up-to-date with the main remote branch: `git pull --rebase`
  - Make a new branch to do your work on: `git checkout -b my-new-feature-branch`
  - Write your code
  - When you're ready to commit your code, add the files you want to your commit. Use `git status` to check which files have been modified and/or added. To add files, use `git add {FILE_NAME}`. Chances are all your edits will be within `src`, so to speed things up you can use `git add src/`.
  - Commit the changes with a message: `git commit -m "added sidebar feature"`
  - Push your changes to your _remote_ branch: `git push origin my-new-feature-branch`
  - If that branch is ready to be merged into the main branch, visit it on github.com and open a pull request.
  - Make sure all the changes make sense and that there are no conflicts, then merge your new feature!
